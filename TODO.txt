Broadphase
  - Seems to be an issue where EVERYTHING is passing the broadphase (as far as
  I can tell at least), don't work on this immediately
  
Narrowphase
  - I need to implement more complex collider types, I'm gonna start with cubes
  (might need to research it as an OBB, because that's basically what it is)
  - SAT might be worth looking into, but not worth worrying extensively about.
  
Constraint Solver
  - I need to handle angular velocity impulse and change in the constraint 
  solver, at the moment only linear is being accounted for. This shouldn't be
  too difficult to implement because I made a shit tonne of comments while only 
  accounting for linear
